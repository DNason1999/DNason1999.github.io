For the first unit project, data visualization, I decdided to look at the optimal color for a Magic the Gathering deck in the October 2019 standard card legality. The color choice was based on the rank of the decks that participated in the 2019 Mythic V Championships. Based on the idea that the best deck would belong to the player that came in first, and the second best is the second place participant, and so on, a ranking of decks could be formed. Based on this, the majority colors of the best deck would be the best colors for a newly built deck in this meta.
