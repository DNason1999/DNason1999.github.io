Loot Hunters 3 was a project to develop and deploy a Django Web API for serving
room and world data to the front end side. I was personally involved in the delopment
of the structure and development of the Django server and its PostgreSQL database.
The main difficulties with this project was learning and working with Django as my 
team and I had only developed with Flask frameworks in the prior to this project. One
of the major issues we ran into was iterating during the development process. Before
we added some features, we would have to rework old ones to be compatible with the new
ones. For example, when we first started working on the project, all the users would be in
the same world at the same time. However, this would cause issues when the world would be reset.
To solve this issue, we had to completely rework the world concept and convert it into an instance
that could be stored in a PostgreSQL database. This same concept would have to be applied to 
some other concepts associated with the world's data so as to be compatible with the new
method of playing the game.
