Loot Hunters 3 was a project to develop and deploy a Django Web API for serving
room and world data to the front end side. I was personally involved in the delopment
of the structure and development of the Django server and its PostgreSQL database.
The main difficulties with this project was learning and working with Django as my 
team and I had only developed with Flask frameworks in the prior to this project.
