This project was created to provide users a web application where they could input medical symptoms
and receive a list of cannabis strains that could potentially treat the provided symptoms. In this project,
I worked on developing a Natual language processor to analyze the strain data and the user input to detect
keywords and attributes to match the symptoms to the best strain to treat those symptoms. The processing
was completed using spacy's natural language processing library. The backend was successfully deployed but
was not connected with the front end by the end date. In the future, I would like to see this deployment
occur as the predictions from the backend seem to be relevant given my test inputs.
