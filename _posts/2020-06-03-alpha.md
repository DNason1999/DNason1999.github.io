The Java Annotation Tool was created to allow point labeling images in an image set for use in machine learning models
There are other tools similar to this on the internet: however, I found them confusing or tedious to use. By using Java,
I can ensure there is platform independence and ease of use. The annotation tool was designed specifically for use with 
Python programs, but the output is a text file and therefore could be used with any language. You can find the link to the
