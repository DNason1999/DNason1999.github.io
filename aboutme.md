My name is Dylan Nason. I am currently a Data Science student at 
Lambda School in the Full Time DS9 Cohort.

Hopefully what I learn at Lambda School will assist me in creating enviornmentally
impactful inventions and help save the world through the application of machine
learning and artificial intelligence.

### My Academic History
I went to a local community college for two years studying for an associates in
Engineering Science. I did not complete the associates degree, but am more excited
about the oppurtunity presented at Lambda SChool
