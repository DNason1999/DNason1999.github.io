My name is Dylan Nason. I am currently a DataScience student at 
Lambda School in the Full Time DS9 Cohort.

Although I haven't been at lambda school very long, I hope to learn
a lot about datascience, machine learning, and artificial intelligence.

Hopefully with what I learn at lambda school, I can create enviornmentally
impactful inventions and help save the world. If Elon Musk can do it, so can I!

### my history
I went to a local community college for two years studying for an associates in
Engineering Science. Before completing my studies, my best friend directed me 
to Lambda School, and now here I am!
